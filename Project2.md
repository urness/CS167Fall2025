# CS 167 — Project 2
## Choose Your Own Machine Learning Adventure

## Learning Objectives 
In this project, you will design and conduct a machine learning experiment of your choosing. Your final write-up should read like a lab report: clearly explaining what you did, presenting your results, and interpreting what those results mean.

This project directly addresses two course learning objectives:

- Students will be able to create software that uses machine learning libraries to perform data analysis.
- Students will be able to design, conduct, interpret, and explain machine-learning-based experiments.

# Project Overview
You will be evaluated on your ability to use the algorithms and tools introduced in this course. Below are the two project paths you may choose from. Regardless of the option selected, your job is to behave like a machine learning engineer: run meaningful experiments, analyze the results, and draw clear conclusions.

# Option 1 — Compare MLPs, CNNs, and a Fine-Tuned AlexNet on Image Data

Choose one of the following datasets, then implement **three models**:
1. An MLP  
2. A CNN  
3. A fine-tuned AlexNet  

Your task is to explore multiple configurations, run experiments, and thoroughly compare model performance.

## Available Datasets

### 🔹 Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection
- Grayscale 200×200 images  
- Labels: **NORMAL** or **PNEUMONIA**  
- Sample code provided (uploading to Kaggle, starter MLP/CNN classes)

### 🔹 Image Classification (bfgmss)
- Color 150×150 images
- Six classes: **building, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street**
- Sample code provided (uploading to Kaggle, starter MLP/CNN classes)

**In your report, explain *why* each model performed the way it did.**
Discuss architecture differences, suitability for the data, and the impact of hyperparameters.

# Project Expectations 
Your final submission will be a **Kaggle iPythong notebook** containing:
- All code used
- All graphs, outputs, and results
- Clear, well-written markdown explanations

Your write-up must include the following sections:

---
### 1. Problem (2 points)
Clearly state the problem you are trying to solve and the goal of your experiment.

---
### 2. Research (10 points)
This is where your **code**, **experiments**, and **model exploration** go.

Your research section must include:
- A description of the process you followed
- Parameter tuning efforts (not just running for more epochs)
- Graphs showing model performance
- Metrics appropriate to your task (accuracy)

---
### 3. Analysis (12 points)
Explain your findings in depth:
- What did you discover?
- Which model performed best, **and why**?
- Which models struggled, **and why**?
- What insights or recommendations do you have?
- How did you decide how long to train/tune the model?

This should be the **richest** and most thoughtful part of your report.

---
### 4. Bumps in the Road (1 point)
Briefly describe your challenges:
- What went wrong?
- How did you fix it or work around it?

# Option 2 — Do Something Interesting with Transformers

Interested in cutting-edge AI? Choose this option to create a project involving **transformers**.

Possible ideas include (but are not limited to):
- Build a **local chatbot** using **Ollama** and host it through a simple **Flask webpage**.
- Create a domain-specific assistant (e.g., a math tutor, cybersecurity advice bot, study helper, etc.).
- Fine-tune a small transformer on a custom dataset.

If you choose this option, your report must include:
- The code you wrote.
- A **user guide** explaining how to use your system.
- **Screenshots and examples** demonstrating your working application.

# Project Expectations 
Your final submission will be a **Google Colab notebook**  and supporting documents containing:
- All code used
- All graphs, outputs, and results
- Clear, well-written markdown explanations
- Screenshots and example interactions

## Use of Generative AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.) 🤖

You **may** use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) for this project **under the following conditions**:

1. **You must clearly cite any AI assistance.**
   - At the top or bottom of your notebook, include a short “AI Acknowledgment” section.
   - Example:  
     > Portions of the code and/or text in this notebook were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT (OpenAI) on 11/25/2025 and then modified by me.

2. **You are fully responsible for understanding all code and analysis you submit.**
   - If you use AI-generated code, you must be able to:
     - Explain what it does line by line.
     - Justify why it is appropriate for the dataset and task.
     - Interpret the results it produces.

3. **Code suspected to be purely AI-generated (and not understood by the student) will be scrutinized.**
   - In such cases, the **analysis, explanations, and depth of understanding** will be held to the **highest standards**.
   - If you cannot explain your own code or results, your grade will reflect that lack of understanding, regardless of how “good” the code looks.

4. **Uncited AI use is treated as academic dishonesty.**
   - If you use AI and do **not** acknowledge it, this may be considered a violation of academic integrity policies.

# Final Notes
- Put **your name** at the top of your notebook.
- Save your file as **YOUR_LAST_NAME_Project2.ipynb**.
- Submit your notebook on **Blackboard**.
